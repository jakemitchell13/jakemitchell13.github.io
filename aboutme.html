	   <center><font color="white"><p>As you know my name is Jacob Mitchell, I am a student at The University of Maine and I am currently studying 
accounting. To start off with a little bit about me, I was raised in a small town 30 minutes 
outside of Boston, called Georgetown. It is a very small town, and I really learned to love the atmosphere of a small community and the benefits that come with it. Throughout my 
life I have always been playing sports, and started off playing all sports as a young kid. As I grew up I settled with two sports, Hockey, and Lacrosse. Hockey was my first love and 
I have been skating since I was 4. I learned to play Lacrosse with my friends from Georgetown and soon learned to enjoy it just as much as Hockey. Some other hobbies that I also enjoy
that are not sports include building/ working on computers, video games, walking my dog, and basically anything to do with space. I have always been a huge fan of music and love to
listen to anything from Aerosmith to Kodak Black, my favorite album is the Incredible True Story by Logic. I have a beatiful german shepard named Luna who I love to walk and play with
 Thanks for taking the time to read a little about me and I hope you enjoy your time on my website. Here are some pictures to help illistrate a little about me.
